# JavaScript RPG Project

#### In this project, I covered the fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding this Role Playing Game. Through this project, I utilized arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, conditional statements, and more.

## What I did
* Arrays: Creating and manipulating arrays to store and manage data.
* Strings: Working with strings to handle text-based data.
* Objects: Creating and using objects to represent complex data structures.
* Functions: Implementing functions to encapsulate and organize code.
* Loops: Using different types of loops to iterate over data and automate repetitive tasks.
* Conditional Statements: Applying if/else statements to control program flow based on conditions.

## Project Overview
* Designing an RPG Game: Planning and implementing my own role-playing game in JavaScript.
* Creating Game Components: Developing characters, inventory systems, and other game elements.
* Managing Game Logic: Using programming concepts to handle the game's flow and events.
* Debugging and Testing: Practicing debugging skills by troubleshooting and refining my code.
